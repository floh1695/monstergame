Statuses
	These work much like ones in DarkSouls, where moves apply some ammount of "status damage", and once
	it passes your "resist threshold" then you get the status. The status threshold then lasts until some
	outside force ends it, or until the "status threshold" drains back to 0 (the speed of which depends
	on the your resist).
	-Poison: Lose a lot of health each turn
	-Stun: Cannot act until expires, drains quickly
	-Sleep: Cannot act until expires, drains slowly, breaks on damage
	-Charm: Help out the enemy, drains quickly
	-Curse: All attributes reduced
	-Petrify: Instant KO, builds slowly
	-Chill: Speed greatly reduced, Ice Defense/Crit Bonus/Crit Evasion/Crit Power reduced next fire attack abosorbed and status gone
	-Blind: Targeted moves fail, speed reduced
	-Silence: Any move requiring sound (spells and sonic) fail
	-Burning: Lose health every turn, cannot act, expires quickly, next water/ice attack absorbed and status gone
	-Confused: High chance to act randomly
