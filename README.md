# *Monster Raising Game to be named later*

## Concept
This game is going to be similar in concept to the Dragon Warrior/Quest
Monsters games but with a more rich attribute system. think Dark Souls like 
attribute system with a classic monster raising game shell.  

The base idea is to make a mechanically deeper form of Dragon Warrior/Quest 
Monster, with a more robust combat found in later Pokemon games.

## Context

### General Setting
An alternate future world, where there is technology, but humans evolved with
these monsters so some tech is at our level but some (namely weaponry) is far behind.
The only supernatural items are artifacts from long past and the monsters themselves. 

### Story
You begin the game as a poor, struggling kid/teen/young adult in a large family. The
empire you belong to has been relativley peaceful and has gotten along well with
monsters, and is at peace.

However, they are currently being invaded by another empire. This empire uses monsters
for battle in ways that your empire never thought of, and as a result, your empire has
been losing this war for a while. Your empire grows desperate.

They begin recruiting monster tamers from anywhere. They come to your village, and you
are forced to tryout. You successfully show your ability to tame monsters, and are then
sent away for training.

While training, you are sent on missions to far away villages, towns, and castles. Along
your journey you discover many monsters, become better as a tamer, and ultimatley become
a major force in ending this war that has gone on for so long.
