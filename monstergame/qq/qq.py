"""
This is sample of how you can implement a tile-based game, not unlike
the RPG games known from consoles, in pygame. It's not a playable game,
but it can be turned into one. Care has been taken to comment it clearly,
so that you can use it easily as a starting point for your game.

The program reads a level definition from a "level.map" file, and uses the
graphics referenced for that file to display a tiled map on the screen and
let you move an animated player character around it.

Note that a lot of additional work is needed to turn it into an actual game.
