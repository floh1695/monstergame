Welcome to QQ PyGame tutorial!
==============================

This is a sort of a tutorial about writing a tile-based animated game in Python_ using PyGame_.  I'm writing it, because it took me some time to figure out a way that works well for me -- it wasn't immediately obvious -- and I'd like to save others some effort.  Please don't treat it as one and the only, or even just best way to do it.  Of course, I'm always interested about hearing about better ways.  I'm also not going to tell you how to write the whole game: I will concentrate on the parts directly related to PyGame_.  You are on your own with the rest.

You can get the final source code and all the graphics at https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/qq
